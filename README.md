# optical_gating
Using EPOCH a particle in cell code for simulating laser-plasma interaction to investigate the non-collinear optical gating scheme. While the projct is complete there is work to be done translating the filter functions into C or Python for future ease of use since filtering fourier transforms can be confusing and cumbersome.
